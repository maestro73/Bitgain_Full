Normal
Improve data process
  - Add more features
	- Technical indicators
	- Mean reverting indicators
		- Speed of reverting
		- Size of reverting 
		- Etc.
  - Select best features (simple model -> better)
	- Permutation Importance
	- Random Forest Estimation
  - Add longer look-back period

Improve machine learning algorithm
  - Select best base model
	- Will probably be a neural net or boosted forest
  - Tune hyper parameters that create best model based on what results
	- Sharpe ratio
	- Risk adjusted returns
	- Overall return
  - Change model from 0 or 1 to a confidence interval from -1 to 1
	- Buy/sell that amount of stock * a multiple (optimized)
  - Use quasi cross-validation by using Time-Series split in scikit-learn
  - Train and validate the model in a separate process then save the final model
	- Use this model to predict buy/sell (quicker while trading and more robust)

Advanced
Create risk management overlay
  - Additional signal to buy/sell which lets you know if performing an order will have too    	much affect on portfolio risk
